C1D.beta12.1D
----
001: lPOP1d = .true.,  lKPP1d = .false.

005: lPOP1d = .true.,  lKPP1d = .false., PT and S forcing [10 year run]
     (First run blew up on Jan 13th, trying with hourly time step instead
     of 2-hour time step)
006: Same as 001, but with hourly timestep
007: Same as 005, but outputting PT_INTERIOR_DATA [hopefully]

C1D.beta12.noBSF
----
001: First attempt at removing BSF from monthly history file (g37)
002: First attempt at removing BSF from monthly history file (g16)

C vs C1D vs C1D + interior forcing
---
Issue with SHF_QSW (shortwave heat flux) when interior forcing is turned on
* premium queue, 30 min walltime
* 1 month run

C.beta12.SHF_QSW: oob
C1D.beta12.SHF_QSW: lconst_coriolis = .true.
C1D+pt_int.beta12.SHF_QSW: PT forcing
C1D+s_int.beta12.SHF_QSW: S forcing
C1D+pt_s_int.beta12.SHF_QSW: S forcing
..._d => DEBUG = TRUE

C1D.beta12.s_int
---
Issue with SHF_QSW (shortwave heat flux) when interior forcing is turned on
* premium queue, 30 min walltime
* 1 month run
* Copy user_nl_pop2 from C1D+s_int.beta12.SHF_QSW

001: SourceMods to comment out set_s_interior call


C1D.beta12.pt+s_int
---
Issue with SHF_QSW (shortwave heat flux) when interior forcing is turned on
* premium queue, 30 min walltime
* 1 month + coupler history every step
* Move SHF_QSW to nstep output
* Copy user_nl_pop2 from C1D+pt_s_int.beta12.SHF_QSW

001: OOB except for changes above
002: OOB including no user_nl_pop2 ("control run")
003: Same as 001, but with flat_bottom = .false.

C1D.LBNL.test_new_namelist
---
Introduce pop1d_nml; set some defaults based on lidentical_columns
* premium queue, 30 min walltime
* run for 1 month

001: 1D out of the box (should have bigger dt_count)
002: set lidentical_columns = .true. [should toggle lconst_Coriolis as well!]
003: add pt restoring
004: add s restoring
005: add pt & s restoring

C1D.LBNL2
---
Using the rc02 LBNL tag, better datasets (no points masked out of restoring
dataset but actually part of the gx3v7 grid -- i.e. Tonga Trench), and setting
salinity normalization coefficient to .001
* premium queue, 30 min walltime
* run for 1 month

001: 1D out of the box (should have bigger dt_count)
002: add pt restoring
003: add s restoring
004: add pt & s restoring
005: same as 002, but with dt_count=12 [original bigger time step]
006: same as 002, but without the "k>1" line in restoring
007: same as 004, but without the "k>1" line in restoring
008: same as 007, but with dt_count=12

ne30_g16
B1D compset
* Change env_run.xml to run for 1 year and turn on coupler history [monthly]
* Change $CASE.run to request premium queue (keep 2 hour walltime)
* SourceMod to gx1v6_tavg_contents to add SST_CPL to stream 2 and SST_ALPHA to 3


B1D.beta12.sst
----
001: out of the box
002: sst_use_obs = .true., files from POP1D-scripts

004: same as 002, but f09_g16
005: same as 004, but with old forcing_tools
005: same as 005, but using LBNL experiment checkout (beta10 + POP + scripts)

----
001: lPOP1d = .true.
     crashed in cice dynamics after 14 days, rerunning w/ kdyn = 0
     [ kdyn = 0 doesn't crash, but SSTs go to missing values after 13 days]
