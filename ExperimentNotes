All C-compset experiments
----
T62_g37
C1D compset
* Change env_run.xml to run for 1 year
* Change $CASE.run to request 30 minutes of premium queue

C1D.beta12.oob
----
001: no namelist changes

C1D.beta12.pt_restore [SourceMod to read TEMPERATURE01 instead of TEMPERATURE 1]
----
001: set pt_interior_restore to true, but don't set pt_interior_data_type [bfb with oob run because there is no forcing]
002: set pt_interior_restore to true, set pt_interior_data_type to monthly
003: same as 002, but without "k>1" condition
004: same as 002, but with pt_interior_interp_type set to"nearest"

C1D.beta12.pt_s_restore [SourceMod to read TEMPERATURE01 instead of TEMPERATURE 1 and SALINITY01 instead of SALINITY  1]
----
001: set pt_interior_restore and s_interior_restore to true, set pt_interior_data_type and s_interior_data_type to monthly
002: same as 001 but without "k>1" condition
003: same as 002 but without CVMix
004: same as 002 but single thread

C1D.beta12.pt_s_restore [SourceMod to read SALINITY01 instead of SALINITY  1]
----
001: set s_interior_restore to true, set s_interior_data_type to monthly

C1D.beta12.sst [All pt/s SourceMods plus new forcing_sst.F90 / namelist; turn on coupler history and add SST_CPL, SST_ALPHA to POP history]
----
001: Currently has SourceMod to force sst_alpha = 0 everywhere (testing interpolation)

C1D.beta12.1D
----
001: lPOP1d = .true.,  lKPP1d = .false.
002: lPOP1d = .false., lKPP1d = .true.
003: lPOP1d = .true.,  lKPP1d = .true., lconst_Coriolis = .true.
004: lPOP1d = .true.,  lKPP1d = .false., lconst_Coriolis = .true.
005: lPOP1d = .true.,  lKPP1d = .false., PT and S forcing [10 year run]
     If fail, try cutting time step

ne30_g16
B1D compset
* Change env_run.xml to run for 1 year and turn on coupler history [monthly]
* Change $CASE.run to request premium queue (keep 2 hour walltime)
* SourceMod to gx1v6_tavg_contents to add SST_CPL to stream 2 and SST_ALPHA to 3


B1D.beta12.sst
----
001: out of the box
002: sst_use_obs = .true., files from POP1D-scripts
003: same as 001, but f09_g16 (for looking at CAM output)
004: same as 002, but f09_g16
005: same as 004, but with old forcing_tools
005: same as 005, but using LBNL experiment checkout (beta10 + POP + scripts)
